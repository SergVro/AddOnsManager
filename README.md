Add-Ons Manager for EPiServer
=========

This is a script that provides a basic interface for managing EPiServer Add-Ons using the command line.
In order to be able to execute the script you need to have EPiServer 7.5 and PowerShell 3 installed.
The script is not signed, so you might need to change the execution policy by running this command in PowerShell command line (x86 if you have a 64 bit OS): 

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
